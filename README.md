# Mortgage Problem Solution

## How it works ?

This program reads the resource prospects.txt from src>main>resources folder and extracts customer name, loan amount, interest rate and number of years to calculate and print the monthly repayments. The source code is in the src>main>java>solution folder. The CustomerLoanProspects defines the Java Object for loan processing and CustomerLoanSolution contains the repayment computation.
